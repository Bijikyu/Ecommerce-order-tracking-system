# Ecommerce-Oder-Tracking-System
<p>An order tracking system allows the customer to gain insight into where their order is
at any given point in time. From the time an order is placed until it is delivered. That
means an order tracking system needs to be able to follow and provide insight into
the status of the order through its entire journey in the Google map to the customer
until it reaches to customer door.</p>
<h3>Why this system is necessary?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Make e-commerce business more efficient.</li></li>
